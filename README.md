# **CountriesApp**

## **OBJECTIVE**
The main idea behind developing this mini project was to increase my domain knowledge in Android Studio. This project introduced me to a whole new concept of Android Architecture and Unit Testing.

Overall it is an application with simple functionality; it displays Country's Name along with its flag and its capital. However it was made like that on purpose because the main objective was to apply complex concepts on a simple application.

Overall Concepts Applied:
- MVVM Architecture 
- Retrofit and JSON
- RxJava
- Dependency Injection
- Unit Testing


MVVM or Model-View-ViewModel is Google's recommended architecture. It allows us to seperate our business logic from the view and from the model in our application. So we have a clear seperation that will help us out when making a complex app. It helps in unit testing, scaling etc etc.

Retrofit and JSON is used to communicate with the backend and get the actual list of countries we want to display. Retrofit is easy to understand and easy to apply. We can worry less about any Network errors using this library.

RxJava is used to seperate Retrofit logic and Business Logic from the application.

Dependency Injection is need for large scale application and Unit Testing. It also helps seperate Business Logic from our Business Objects.

Unit Testing is used to make sure that the functionality of an application doesnt change overtime. So if we add some new logic , unit testing allows us to make sure that what we add will not impact the existing technology.
